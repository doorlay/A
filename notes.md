It looks like you can indeed input vanguard index fund ticker symbols and get return data from it.

I can use this to update my portfolio value that is contained in google sheets. I can then also create this to be open source and fully functional to everyone. 

It's relatively unlikely that this will be something that a ton of people want to use, but it's a great thing to include on my resume and have on my github, and 
i'll likely have at least a few stars and forks (I already do).
